can you remember that summer night when you softly called my name you said come if you can i’m feeling so bad drove all night to be with you again your husband was twenty light years from home making money to buy one more car his letters himself distant and cold my passion and pride like a star we laughed and we cried side by side breath to breath heart by heart hand in hand it's only the love was never so close as the waves left the tears on the side throw me a lifeline draw me a heartline can you remember how we were before throw me a lifeline draw me a heartline once in a lifetime long long time ago three nuns on the beach watched the sun going down your eyes can drift on the wave besides you between you deep in your heart falling heart to the end of the day we laughed and we cried side by side breath to breath heart by heart hand in hand you told me the love was never so close as the waves left the tears on the side throw me a lifeline draw me a heartline can you remember how we were before throw me a lifeline draw me a heartline once in a lifetime long long time ago can you remember that summer night when you softly called my name you said come if you can i’m feeling so bad i came but i just couldn’t stay i don’t really know how it began and i don’t know why it died love was coming love was going i don’t sleep alone but something still hurts there inside
