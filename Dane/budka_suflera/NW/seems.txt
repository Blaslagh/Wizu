seems i got to have a change of scenes everynight i have the strangest dreams imprisoned by the way it could have been left he are on my own or so it seemed i got to leave before i start to scream before someone locks the door and takes to keys feelin' alright i'm not feelin' to good myself feelin' alright i'm not feelin' to good myself boy you shelter me with warmth and rye and even now i sit and i wonder why that when i think of you i start myself to cry just can't waste my time i must get by gotta stop believin' in all your lies well there's too much to do before i die feelin' alright i'm not feelin' to good myself feelin' alright i'm not feelin' to good myself ooh don't you get too lost in all i say in a better time you know i really found that way but that was then and now you know it's today i can't get set for it guess i'm here to stay till someone comes along and takes my place with a different name and a different face feelin' alright i'm not feelin' to good myself feelin' alright i'm not feelin' to good myself
