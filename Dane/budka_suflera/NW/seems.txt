seems i got to have a change of scenes everynight i have the strangest dreams imprisoned by the way it could have been left he are on my own or so it seemed i got to leave before i start to scream before someone locks the door and takes to keys feelin alright im not feelin to good myself feelin alright im not feelin to good myself boy you shelter me with warmth and rye and even now i sit and i wonder why that when i think of you i start myself to cry just cant waste my time i must get by gotta stop believin in all your lies well theres too much to do before i die feelin alright im not feelin to good myself feelin alright im not feelin to good myself ooh dont you get too lost in all i say in a better time you know i really found that way but that was then and now you know its today i cant get set for it guess im here to stay till someone comes along and takes my place with a different name and a different face feelin alright im not feelin to good myself feelin alright im not feelin to good myself
