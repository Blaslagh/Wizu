when you get there and you have time to spare write me and say that youre okay homes not the same when you left you took its name home is us not me alone i dance with ghosts now you know them all im still in love with what we were not what is now i live in the past though we know memory wont last candle flame tomorrows never the same break and yes im still angry at you for taking a precious thing that belonged to we two leaving me you stole something that wasnt only yours— we made it together not two hands but four i believed we were forever i believed in nothing more just me alone now dancing with our ghosts since you left ive learned to be their perfect host i believed we were forever i believed in nothing more i dance with ghosts now you know them all im still in love with what we were not what is now
