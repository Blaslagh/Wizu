when you get there and you have time to spare write me and say that you’re okay home’s not the same when you left you took its name home is us not me alone i dance with ghosts now you know them all i’m still in love with what we were not what is now i live in the past though we know memory won’t last candle flame tomorrow’s never the same break and yes i’m still angry at you for taking a precious thing that belonged to we two leaving me you stole something that wasn’t only yours— we made it together not two hands but four i believed we were forever i believed in nothing more just me alone now dancing with our ghosts since you left i’ve learned to be their perfect host i believed we were forever i believed in nothing more i dance with ghosts now you know them all i’m still in love with what we were not what is now
