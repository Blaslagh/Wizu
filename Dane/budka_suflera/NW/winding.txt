winding your way down on baker street light in your head and dead on your feet well another crazy day you'll drink the night away and forget about everything this city desert makes you feel so cold it's got so many people but it's got no soul and it's taking you so long to find out you were wrong when you thought it held everything you used to think that it was so easy you used to see that it was so easy but you're trying you're trying now another year and then you'll be happy just one more year and then you'll be happy but you're crying you're crying now way down the street there's a lot in this place he opens the door he's got that look on his face and he asks you where you've been you tell him who you've seen and you talk about anything he's got this dream about buying some land he's gonna give up the booze and the one night stands and then you'll settle down with some quiet little town and forget about everything but you know you'll always keep moving you know he's never gonna stop moving 'cause he's rolling he's the rolling stone when you wake up it's a new morning the sun is shining it's a new morning and you're going you're going home
