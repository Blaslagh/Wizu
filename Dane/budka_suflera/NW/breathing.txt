breathing you lasts a lifetime wanting you twice as long the blind man now sees in color his weak eyes grown strong breathing you makes its own rules wanting you knows no laws when two hearts dance together they need no applause i walked too many streets and days alone saw too many lives i wished were my own every hour the life that i wore was the thinnest fabric that so easily tore and i promised i prayed and i cried for just one chance to live days on fire all the poets said it was true what they didnt tell me was i needed you breathing you parts the waters wanting you clears the skies that first breath of you changed all others days on fire never lie
