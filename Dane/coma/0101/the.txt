the struggle on the earth and the sky the struggle of mine my sacrifice i never give up and i try to fight for the faith in the rescue im struggling getting out of bed my dance on the scene of incidents i never give up and i try to fight for the faith in the rescue this place is lost in the emptiness its a sleepy space of infirmity i never give up and i try to fight for the right to the struggle i hear the angry murmurs all around of sad and salty evenings with no hope i never give up and i try to fight for the faith in the rescue of my soul if you dont use your lazy brain every day it leaves the struggle and its dying away once i was told that itll be this way in toil youll struggle all your days till the end struggle againts the struggle again and the time is running out to the end i never give up and i try to fight for the faith in the rescue the struggle and rage againts the law for establishing another norm i never give up and try to fight for the right to the struggle here is the space of the chronic silence and the life is slipping out of my hands i never give up and i try to fight for the faith in the rescue i feel sorrow for all that i couldnt tame i feel sorrow for all these missing days i never give up and i try to fight for the faith in the rescue of my soul if you dont use your lazy brain every day it leaves the struggle and its dying away once i was told that itll be this way in toil youll struggle all your days till the end
