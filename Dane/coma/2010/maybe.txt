maybe i will never be a perfect man maybe i will never say a clever thing maybe i will never fall in love again maybe i’ll never have a strong will there has never been such confusion i have never felt so exhausted though i didn’t believe the illusion now i see i’m living inside a dream if i had a fantastic body if i were an ideal product if i managed to finish college maybe then i would be successful fate was never so tricky with me aims were never so pointless as now days were never so sad and so sweet now i feel desire of being every opposition every contradiction they could never kill me but strengthened me forever i am strong enough now i am strong i am strong enough now i am strong
