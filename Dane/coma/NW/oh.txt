oh my brother will you get it what i feel and what i want to share with you the great extinction of our kind it comes i feel like we were already fossilized we are like blue birds of dreams unlimited but now all is dying its seems such a pitiful shame later… when the dreams wont be needed later… when the treacherous science will captivate us later… we will stop being pretty later… but now let us bless this escaping time witnesses of the decline of the eternal boys land oh everything that will come after our time itll be really good and really fucking sad theres no chance at all for the wreckless souls the happy kingdom is brought to ruin try to thinks of it that the end is near try to think that the end is the end for thee artists are just little strumpets they try to seduce you desire your money i know i am one of them no one will miss a little strumpet you use her you squeeze her you buy her and fuck her and then you just throw it away later… when the dreams wont be needed later… when the treacherous science will captivate us later… we will stop being pretty later… but now let us bless this escaping time witnesses of the decline of the eternal boys land oh everything that will come after our time itll be really good and really fucking sad
