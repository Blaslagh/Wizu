i am stuck in the place beyond a time lights melting gently in my head somehow all sadness passed away im afraid this moment passes by far from the maddening of crowds we give in tothe impact of the night maybe were only hypnotized lets sing the glory of this time the world hid itself deep in the mist trying to find some strenght and a breath when well get up from the dream to live there will be grief there will be fear far from the maddening of crowds we give in tothe impact of the night maybe were only hypnotized lets sing the glory of this time before the scream will fill these dreams before the noise drowns out my singing try feel silence and fire try to save this moment of silence oh we can belive it oh we have to belive that this is the moment enjoy this time oh i can belive it oh i have to trythis single moment the only time when silence silence and fire they call me they make me desire silence and fire everlasting desire in me
