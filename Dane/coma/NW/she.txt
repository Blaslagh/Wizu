she captived burning up within me fiery water distilled from barley grains a handful of mexican leaves and i had run out of breath this state in resemblance to a dream i know a lot o them i know a lot of these plants which are doping the head which are stealing time but still none of them could compare to you could dazzle me and take away my guilt meadows at the end summer i squeezed the oily seasonal evil straight from them beautiful unbearable strength in which the darkness is bursting through me i know a lot o them i know a lot of these plants which are doping the head which are stealing time but still none of them could compare to you could dazzle me and take away all these sins again and again on the fragile wave of my time i'm flying so high an then i fall down to the ground and then onwards with my hands full of poisonous plants everything i had was so easily lost if only for moment i lost myself confidence if only for a moment i lost my will to go on would you be able to give me another chance would you be able again to rescue my soul always silent and narrow streets in the valley of shadows if you don't help me again i'll never get out from here so would you give me the chance if you don't help me again i'll never get out from here let me go back safe
