warsaw the suffocating wind blows winter's coming closer thoughts are getting sad who said climate's moderate here the frost is really severe and it lasts over half a year oh no aimless is a prayer for the sun's rays it makes me really depressed i'm crying out of hope you said move pack your bags babe let's get out of this place direction is the happiness sand in the shoes little shells in the pocket honey and fruits and tequilla for supper your freckled nose it is proof of betrayal a sign of your kisses with the sun all these days i'm never gonna forget our suspension in the summer i'm never gonna forget this slow motion of time even if winter is freezing my memory even if gloomy november is breaking me down again
