angel came down from heaven yesterday she stayed with me just long enough to rescue me and she told me a story yesterday about the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue sea and then she spread her wings high over me she said she's gonna come back tomorrow and i said fly on my sweet angel fly on through the sky fly on my sweet angel tomorrow i'm gonna be by your side sure enough this morning came on to me silver wings silhouetted against the child's sunrise and my angel she said on to me today is the day for you to rise take my hand you're gonna be my man you're gonna rise and then she took me high over yonder and i said fly on my sweet angel fly on through the sky fly on my sweet angel forever i will be by your side
