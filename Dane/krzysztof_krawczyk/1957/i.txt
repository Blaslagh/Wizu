i can't stop loving you so i've made up my mind to live in memories of old lonesome times i can't stop wanting you it's useless to say so i'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday those happy hours that we once knew though long ago still make me blue they say that time heals the broken heart but time is stood still since we've been apart i can't stop loving you so i've made up my mind to live in memories of old lonesome times i can't stop wanting you it's useless to say so i'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday
