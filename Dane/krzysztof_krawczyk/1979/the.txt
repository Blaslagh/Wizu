the first time that i ever kissed your lips i felt a burning deep inside i dont know what exactly happened next but i recall a single word goodbye people come and people go some even stay for longer parting is a fact of life youre free to go forever ill be here if you need a friend come around and see me again but if you have to go dont say goodbye i have to realize what no one knows has ever made me feel before i know that its the first time and the last a single word will bring me so much sorrow people come and people go some even stay for longer parting is a fact of life youre free to go forever ill be here if you need a friend come around and see me again but if you have to go dont say goodbye people come and people go some even stay for longer parting is a fact of life youre free to go forever ill be here if you need a friend come around and see me again but if you have to go dont say goodbye goodbye
