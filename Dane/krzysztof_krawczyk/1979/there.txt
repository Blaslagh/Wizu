there comes a time when everything goes wrong and nothing helps you neither drink nor song before you start complaining of your bad luck see if you are sure there is nothing that can be done never call it a day before sundown don't throw tickets away before a ride don't cry over spilt milk getting your pint let the hands of the clock make one more round don't change partners until the music starts till you're sure you're dead don't call the cops never find a new man while i am around if you feel you are wrong don't say all right there is much more to life than silly games you better cool it down and try to smile before you learn to keep your sorrows at bay let me tell you girl you should try and do it my way never call it a day before sundown don't throw tickets away before a ride don't cry over spilt milk getting your pint let the hands of the clock make one more round don't change partners until the music starts till you're sure you're dead don't call the cops never find a new man while i am around if you feel you are wrong don't say all right never call it a day before sundown don't throw tickets away before a ride don't cry over spilt milk getting your pint let the hands of the clock make one more round never call it a day
