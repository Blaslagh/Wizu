i don't care who's bound to glory i just try to live my story i like to spend my sunday mornings on a beach i don't know where my life is going i don't care for such kind of knowing i'm doing all that i can but everybody knows that i'm rich who said the time is money who cares it's fun it's funny i have some time and money but i've got my whole life to plan who said the time is money my peace it got no money my private time is money and then go have fun until the end i'm not a kind of girl that's easy it's so hard to make me smile and tease me i like it a lot when something new knocks on my door i don't know when my train finds the station but i know that i'm alwyas patient i got no reason to hurry when everybody knows that i'm poor who said the time is money who cares it's fun it's funny i have some time and money but i've got my whole life to plan who said the time is money my peace it got no money my private time is money and then go have fun until the end
