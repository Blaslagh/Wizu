your dreams are where i talk to you the rose you grow the moon the smoke you share for two and me your dreams are in the way of where youre cold on new years eve till dawn on august nights so hard and springs we miss a lot so when the dreams can finally come can make our days so bright and stop your lonely tears your tears so if theres no more tear to save for you the clock is weary too the day has gone too soon and no ones here for you for good goodnight love goodnight love dreams are dancing still in your head try to keep them warm make them stay goodnight love goodnight love barely feel the heat at my door windows closed the days passed theyre gone we die scatting your dreams are where you meet with mr queen tequilas mixed with gin after a three day spleen your sun is history dobranoc dobranoc scatting goodnight love goodnight love barely feel the heat at my door windows closed the days passed theyre gone dobranoc dobranoc scatting goodnight love goodnight love barely feel the heat at my door windows closed the days passed theyre gone dobranoc one day ill fly ill fly away
