my throat is bare theres a sense of danger i feel a hand and the hand is strange the hand is dead red blood on my hand and as you die i dont feel your pain where am i now what is this crowd of creatures all around me what can i do inside the zoo the zoo that has no keeper the dogs of war score and reassemble their fangs go deep sleep is blind to pain i feel their breath death is no stranger the vulture soars claws tear out my eyes where am i now what is this crowd of creatures all around me what can i do inside the zoo the zoo that has no keeper theres no way out of this jungle just no way out of this jungle outside my door four men are waiting they have the same names but no one knows the light goes out i shout but no one hears me i feel a hand and the hand is strange where am i now what is this crowd of creatures all around me what can i do inside the zoo the zoo that has no keeper
