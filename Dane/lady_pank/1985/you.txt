you are a hero you are a god the crowd is always with you waiting for your nod the morning papers always have something you to say the stakes are very high in the game you want to play you touch the button with your trembling hand the castles you are building are made of sand you walk on water you play with fire you'll lose the game you're playing unless the stakes go higher you know exactly when things could go too far but no one seems to wonder who you really are you touch the button with your trembling hand the castles you are building are made of sand they're made of sand/ 2x records that you play go on without you things are moving fast what can you do give the wheel another spin in your tower make it look like things are still in your power you touch the button they're made of sand/2x you touch the button /2x are made of sand they're made of sand/x3
