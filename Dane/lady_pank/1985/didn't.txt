didn't want to make trouble i just wanted to try and see if i could burst your bubble 'cause you looked so nice to me when i touched you you shivered but i thought things would be ok thought i'd drown in your river but you had something else to say you shouldn't be naughty you shouldn't be so bad you shouldn't be naughty you shouldn't get up to no good didn't think that you meant it so i gave you another squeeze didn't think you'd resent it but you still kept on saying to me you shouldn't you're so bad is all you can tell me be a good boy is all you can say don't be wicked is all you keep saying don't be naughty that way didn't want to make trouble i just wanted to play some games needed someone to cuddle but you kept on saying the same you shouldn't
