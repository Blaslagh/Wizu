sometimes i've just had enough and i feel that life is kinda tough maybe i could work it out but there's nothing that i care about i'm just a stranger i'm just a stranger here no one near i'm just a stranger i'm just a stranger here i live in fear sometimes someone says to me you need love and maybe sympathy maybe i could find my way but there's no one that i love today i'm just a stranger i'm just a stranger here no one near i'm just a stranger i'm just a stranger here i live in fear
