what's that you've got what's that you've got inside i've got my music you know it gets me by turn on the radio turn my troubles away it's my drug that's going to eat me someday king of guitars falling from the sky there's so many want to give it a try hits of the radio small boy's fantasy some say who cares what it really means 'cause it's only rock and roll nothing more only rock and roll rock and roll nothing more travelled so fast need something to hold on to their so much sit back inside with you so turn on the radio turn it way up high it's so easy and you know it gets me by and it's only rock and roll
