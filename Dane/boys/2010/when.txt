when love is dying summer days seem so cold truth is always solid never old these moments happened as a long and silent cry your last words were painful so goodbye ref you are so crazy so insane but life without you cannot be the same youre not an angel and no saint you are so crazy… bis your final smile seemed like roses in the sand now youre leaving this must be the end there is no question that our love was very true i miss those moments so do you ref you are so crazy…
