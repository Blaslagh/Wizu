now the world is so dark everyday just seems hard and the nights are full of tears i was so happy when we could walk holding hands then one day you just left… ref you are so far away and i feel so much pain everyday i must pray hoping you will come back…x2 somewhere deep in my heart theres an image of us and the first time we met now the days which go by seem like years full of lies love is blind i must say… ref you are so far away…
